# session/v04/DECISIONS.md — append-only (v0.4 "prove the thesis" build)

- 2026-08-11 supervisor: v0.4 plan approved. Spine = thesis experiment (guarded cheap vs
  unguarded, vs frontier reference), OpenCode + cheap open model, prep-release-no-publish.
  Canonical plan: ~/.claude/plans/swirling-foraging-key.md. Continues v0.3-autonomous.
- 2026-08-11 supervisor: Phase 0 (correctness floor) launched first — a leaky floor would
  confound the experiment's guarded arm. Lane: floors-non-overridable in mergeRules +
  self-protection-write read-FP fix + STATE_DIR per-construction env read.
- 2026-08-11 supervisor: PHASE-2 FEASIBILITY CONFIRMED (probe, zero spend). Free model
  `opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free` via `opencode run --model ...` completed a headless task
  (wrote hello.txt="hello", exit 0, ~fast) in a /tmp scratch git repo. The cheap arm is real
  and free; OpenCode is keel-live so the guarded arm is a true end-to-end test. Frontier
  reference candidates (paid, within cap): opencode-go/grok-4.5, gpt-5.6-luna, kimi-k3.
  Harness (scripts/thesis-eval/) can target the free model as Arm A/B with no budget risk.
