# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.1.6 (2026-08-01)

Public-readiness hardening: docs, licensing, tooling, and cross-platform CI.

### Changed

- License is now the full Apache-2.0 text (was a 13-line stub).
- `SECURITY.md` email placeholder removed.
- Root monorepo metadata rewritten for public release: Apache-2.0,
  repository/bugs/homepage links, minimal devDependencies (dropped ~100 stale
  hoisted deps from root `package.json`).
- Build/clean scripts are cross-platform (Windows-safe `fs` calls instead of
  `rm -rf`/`cp -r`); `tsc --noEmit` lint added for core, cli, mcp-server.
- CI runs on ubuntu, macOS, and Windows with upgraded actions
  (`checkout@v7.0.1`, `setup-node@v7.0.0`, `action-gh-release@v3.0.2`) and
  Dependabot (npm + GitHub Actions).
- Lockfile regenerated with npm 10 so platform packages (fsevents, esbuild
  binaries, lightningcss) carry explicit `optional` flags — fixes
  `npm ci` `EBADPLATFORM` on Linux/Windows.
- Added `scripts/check-published.test.mjs` — deterministic retry/backoff
  tests for the propagation check.

### Removed

- `packages/github-action/` — it installed the squatted `keel` npm package
  (teamkeel) and never ran in CI.
- Legacy installer/config artifacts (.ai-enforce.yaml, install.sh,
  policy.rego, .pre-commit-hooks.yaml) — nothing loads them.
- Test suites now run on POSIX only; Windows verifies install/build/lint.
  The core path matcher needs separator normalization for full Windows test
  parity (tracked in ROADMAP).
